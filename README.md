Previously, I am a **Java Senior Software Engineer** with over **7 years of experience** in designing and building large-scale, high-concurrency distributed systems using Java microservices.

Currently, I'm expanding my expertise into **AI Infrastructure and LLM Applications**, applying my deep engineering background to build robust and efficient systems that power intelligent solutions. I am passionate about creating value at the intersection of solid software architecture and cutting-edge AI.

Based in **Singapore** right now

### 🏆 Featured Projects

Here are some projects that highlight my capabilities across both domains.

#### AI Infrastructure & LLM Applications

1.  **RAG System for Domain-Specific Q&A**
    - Engineered a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using `Mistral-7B`,`chatGPT-o4-mini`, `ElasticSearch` for a specialized knowledge domain.
    - Optimized the system for real-time interaction through efficient data processing and a high-throughput inference server deployment.

2.  **LLM Inference Acceleration & Fine-tuning**
    - Customized open-source LLMs (`Mistral`, `Qwen`, `Llama`) using **LoRA** fine-tuning techniques on specific datasets.
    - Accelerated model inference significantly using **vLLM** and **FlashAttention**, deploying them as scalable API endpoints on cloud platforms like **GCP** and **Azure**.

3.  **pytorch & vLLM & Triton & DeepSpeed & Transformers & ray Contribution (Ongoing)**



#### Java Microservices & System Architecture

1.  **Group-Level Multi-functional Payment Platform**
    - Architected and developed a highly available,  enterprise-grade payment center using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and a robust microservices architecture.
    - The system reliably handles millions of transactions in a specific period time and smoothly process tens of thousands of transactions or more every day, ensuring data consistency and security across various payment channels.

2.  **High-Concurrency Instant Messaging System**
    - Built a distributed IM system from the ground up to support millions of concurrent users.
    - Leveraged a powerful tech stack including `Spring Boot`, `WebSocket`, `Kafka` for message queuing, and `Zookeeper` for service coordination, achieving high throughput and low latency.

3.  **Enterprise Search & Real-Time Data Platform**
    - Designed a high-performance search engine using `Elasticsearch` and `Flink-CDC` capable of indexing and searching billions of records with sub-second latency.
    - Built the underlying real-time data synchronization pipeline, providing a unified data backbone for multiple business units.
  
4.  **Enterprise Flink computing Platform**
    - Enterprise-level Flink Cluster: Built a unified Flink-based computing center for real-time data lake, stats center, and ETL pipelines.
