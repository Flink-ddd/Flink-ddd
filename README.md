ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @Flink-ddd, a passionate senior  engineer with a solid foundation in Java development and microservices architecture, practical Python programming experience, and a growing focus on AI infrastructure and large language model (LLM) applications.

1ï¼šJava & System Architecture
Microservices & DevOps Expert: In-depth understanding of system design, deployment pipelines, and scalable architecture.

Secondary Development & System Integration: Deep customization of mainstream technology stacks to improve business agility.

Key Projects:
Monitoring & Alerting Platform:
Built a full-link business monitoring system via secondary development of Prometheus + Grafana, supporting multi-channel alerts (SMS, Email, IM platforms), covering server, API, and business process levels.

High-Concurrency Messaging System:
Using Spring Boot, WebSocket, Kafka, Zookeeper, MinIO, built an IM system supporting millions of users with features like group chat, voice/video calls.

Enterprise Search Platform:
Leveraged SpringBoot, Elasticsearch, Flink-CDC, MongoDB, to build a high-performance search engine for billions of records.

Knowledge Graph Center:
Designed a Neo4j-based system to support evolving business relationships and semantic query logic.

Multi-functional Payment Platform:
Developed a group-level payment center using DDD (Domain-Driven Design), handling millions of transactions per day.

Real-Time Data Sync Platform:
Built a visualized synchronization platform using Flink-CDC, supporting heterogeneous source sync to MQ/DB with configurable strategies.


2ï¼šBig Data Expertise
Experience with real-time stream processing, data lake, and OLAP solutions.

Projects:
Enterprise-level Flink Cluster:
Built a unified Flink-based computing center for real-time data lake, stats center, and ETL pipelines.

OLAP Solutions with ClickHouse:
Delivered a responsive analytics experience with massive datasets using ClickHouse.

Log Aggregation Platform:
Implemented enterprise-scale log collection via Flume, integrated with downstream analytics.


3ï¼šAI & LLM Projects
Currently exploring and implementing AI technologies with hands-on focus on:

Model Fine-tuning: Customizing open-source LLMs (e.g., Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen) via LoRA techniques.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Building intelligent Q&A and search systems by integrating vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Milvus) with LLMs.

LLM Inference Acceleration: Using vLLM, FlashAttention, and RunPod for high-performance deployment.

Recent Work Includes:
Training a domain-specific chatbot using Mistral + LoRA + Huggingface datasets.
Building end-to-end pipelines for RAG-based medical Q&A systems.
Deploying API endpoints for real-time LLM interaction and content generation.
